### **What is RabbitMQ?**

RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software that facilitates communication between different services (producers and consumers) by handling message queues. 
It allows asynchronous communication and decouples the sender (producer) from the receiver (consumer), which is particularly useful in microservices architectures, distributed systems, and event-driven applications.
RabbitMQ is based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and supports other protocols like STOMP and MQTT. 
It efficiently routes, stores, and delivers messages between various components of an application or between different applications.

### **Key Components of RabbitMQ**

1. **Producer**:
   - The component responsible for creating and sending messages.
   - The producer does not directly send messages to a queue but to an exchange, which routes the messages to queues based on defined rules.

2. **Consumer**:
   - The component responsible for receiving and processing messages from queues.
   - Consumers can be any service or application that connects to RabbitMQ to pull messages from a specific queue.

3. **Queue**:
   - A storage area where messages are stored until they are consumed by a consumer.
   - RabbitMQ ensures that messages are delivered to consumers reliably and in order (FIFO by default).
   - Queues are bound to exchanges and receive messages from them.

4. **Exchange**:
   - Responsible for receiving messages from producers and routing them to the appropriate queue(s).
   - Types of exchanges:
     - **Direct**: Routes messages to queues based on a matching routing key.
     - **Topic**: Routes messages to queues based on pattern matching of the routing key (wildcards).
     - **Fanout**: Routes messages to all bound queues, ignoring the routing key.
     - **Headers**: Routes messages based on headers instead of routing keys.

5. **Binding**:
   - A link between a queue and an exchange.
   - Bindings define how messages from an exchange are routed to specific queues, typically based on routing keys or message attributes.

6. **Message**:
   - A message consists of a payload (the actual data being sent) and properties (metadata, like headers, content type, and priority).
   - Messages are sent by producers and consumed by consumers via queues.

7. **Connection**:
   - A long-lived connection between the application and RabbitMQ server.
   - Multiple channels can be opened on a single connection to increase efficiency.

8. **Channel**:
   - A lightweight connection between the application and RabbitMQ.
   - Producers and consumers use channels to publish and receive messages.
   - Multiple channels can be multiplexed over a single connection to save resources.

9. **Broker**:
   - RabbitMQ itself acts as a broker, responsible for managing exchanges, queues, bindings, and message delivery between producers and consumers.

10. **Virtual Host (vhost)**:
    - A logical grouping of resources such as exchanges, queues, and bindings within RabbitMQ.
    - Different applications or users can use different virtual hosts to keep resources isolated from each other.

11. **Routing Key**:
    - A key used by exchanges to determine how to route a message to a specific queue.
    - Routing keys are mainly used with **Direct** and **Topic** exchanges.

12. **Dead-Letter Exchange (DLX)**:
    - An exchange where messages that are rejected or not processed (e.g., due to timeouts or errors) are sent.
    - Useful for handling failed messages for further analysis or retry.


### **How to Install and Run RabbitMQ in Docker**

Using Docker to run RabbitMQ is a quick and easy method for setting up the service in a local development environment or even in production. 
Here's how you can set it up, along with instructions for creating exchanges, queues, and bindings.
1. **Install RabbitMQ with Docker**

   Ensure you have Docker on your machine. You can install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

    **Step 1: Pull the RabbitMQ Docker Image**
   
   Use the following command to pull the RabbitMQ image from Docker Hub:
   
         docker pull rabbitmq:3-management
   
   The `3-management` tag includes the RabbitMQ Management Plugin, which provides a web UI to monitor queues, exchanges, and bindings.
    
    **Step 2: Run RabbitMQ in a Docker Container**
   
   Run the RabbitMQ container with the following command:
   
         docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
   
    - '-d': Runs the container in the background.
      -'--name rabbitmq': Assigns a name to the container.
    - '-p 5672:5672': Maps RabbitMQ's main service port.
    - '-p 15672:15672': Maps the management plugin's web UI port.
    
   After running the command, RabbitMQ will be accessible at:
   - **RabbitMQ service**: 'localhost:5672'
   - **RabbitMQ Management Web UI**: 'http://localhost:15672'
   
   You can log in to the web UI using the default credentials:
   - **Username**: guest
   - **Password**: guest

2. **Create Exchanges, Queues, and Bindings via Web UI**
   You can create exchanges, queues, and bindings either programmatically or using the RabbitMQ Management Web UI.

   **Step 1: Access the RabbitMQ Web UI**
   
      Go to http://localhost:15672 and log in with the default credentials (guest/guest).
   
   **Step 2: Create a Queue**
      1. Navigate to the **Queues** tab.
      2. Click the **Add a new queue** button.
      3. Enter the following details:
         - **Name**: Choose a name for your queue, e.g., `myQueue`.
         - **Durable**: Check this option if you want the queue to survive server restarts.
         - **Auto-delete**: Leave unchecked unless you want the queue to be deleted when the last consumer disconnects.
      5. Click **Add Queue**.
          
   **Step 3: Create an Exchange**
      1. Go to the **Exchanges** tab.
      2. Click the **Add a new exchange** button.
      3. Enter the following details:
          - **Name**: Choose a name for your exchange, e.g., `myExchange`.
          - **Type**: Select an exchange type (common options are `direct`, `topic`, `fanout`).
          - **Durable**: Check this if you want the exchange to persist after a restart.
      4. Click **Add Exchange**.
          
   **Step 4: Bind the Queue to the Exchange**
      1. Go to the **Queues** tab and select the queue you just created (e.g., `myQueue`).
      2. Scroll down to the **Bindings** section.
      3. Click the **Add binding from this queue** button.
      4. Enter the following details:
         - **From Exchange**: Choose the exchange you created (e.g., `myExchange`).
         - **Routing Key**: Enter a routing key (e.g., `myRoutingKey`).
      6. Click **Bind**.


### Steps to Create Exchange, Queues, and Bindings with Routing Keys in Spring Boot AMQP RabbitMQ Example

In this Spring Boot application, we will demonstrate how RabbitMQ sends messages to different queues based on the exchange and routing keys. 
We will create two queues, bind them to one exchange using two different routing keys, and route messages accordingly.

Follow the steps below to configure RabbitMQ using its web interface and Spring Boot:
   1. **Login to RabbitMQ Management UI**
      
      Open your browser and log in to the RabbitMQ web interface at: [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672).
      
   2. **Create an Exchange**
      
      Navigate to the **Exchanges** tab and create a new exchange named **`rabbitmq.exchange.demo`**.
      
   3. **Create Two Queues**
      
      Go to the **Queues** tab and create the following two queues:
      - **`rabbitmq.queue.demo`**
      - **`rabbitmq.jsonQueue.demo`**
        
   4. **Bind Queues to the Exchange with Routing Keys**
      
      Bind the two queues to the **`rabbitmq.exchange.demo`** exchange using the following routing keys:
      - **`rabbitmq.routingkey.demo`** for **`rabbitmq.queue.demo`**.
      - **`rabbitmq.jsonQueue.routingKey`** for **`rabbitmq.jsonQueue.demo`**.

By following these steps, you'll set up an exchange and two queues in RabbitMQ, and messages will be routed to the respective queues based on their routing keys.

### Running the Spring Boot Application and Testing Message Production and Consumption

After setting up RabbitMQ, follow these steps to check out the code from the Git repository, open it in your favorite IDE, and run the Spring Boot application. Ensure that RabbitMQ is running locally before starting the Spring Boot app.

1. **Clone the Git Repository**

    Check out the code for this project from the Git repository. You can use the following command in your terminal:
    
        git clone <repository-url>
    
    Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Open the Project in Your IDE**

    Open the cloned project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

3. **Run the Spring Boot Application**

    Make sure RabbitMQ is running locally, then run the Spring Boot application. You can do this by executing the main method in your `Application` class or using your IDE's built-in run feature.

4. **Test the Endpoints**
    
    Once the Spring Boot application is up and running, you can test the message production and consumption by hitting the following endpoints:
    
    **a. To Produce and Consume String Messages:**
    
    - Send a GET request to the following URL:
    - Here, you can replace **`hello`** with your desired message.
      
            http://localhost:8080/api/v1/publish?message=hello
      
    
    **b. To Produce and Consume JSON Messages:**
   
   - Send a POST request to the following URL:
   -  Include the following JSON in the request body:
     
           http://localhost:8080/api/v1/publishJson
     
           
            {
              "id": 1,
              "firstName": "John",
              "lastName": "Cena"
            }

6. **Optional: Comment Out Consumer Code**
   - If you want to see only the produced messages in RabbitMQ without consuming them, you can comment out the consumer code in the Spring Boot application. This way, you can produce messages using the above endpoints and check the produced messages in the RabbitMQ web interface.
   
By following these steps, you will be able to run the Spring Boot application and test the message production and consumption functionalities using RabbitMQ.
